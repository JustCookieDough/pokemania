# Pokemania
howdy ho gang. building this in (mostly) pure html/css/js w/ flask cause frameworks are for nerdssssss.
also because im bad at svelte and vue and dont know react or angular lol.

### Todo
- ~~Logins via OAuth2 through discord (gonna be fucking annoying)~~
- ~~Profile Setup~~
- Bracket Data Structure
- Bracket Display
- ~~Leaderboards (see ideas for what they'll look like)~~
- Betting Baybeeee (lets go gambling!)
- ~~Admin Panel~~
- Bracketmaster Panel

### Ideas/Future Features
- Leaderboards: Total Coins, Total Progression, March Madness Style scores 
- More advanced bets: parlays, number of prize cards, number of turns
- More Bracket Shapes: 8/16 double elim, pools -> final showdown, nfl?, others
- Drafting: auto-drafting with preference orders so we dont have to spend 25 gd hours on it each time
- Discord Integration: ping when its time to bet/draft, updates w/ bot, betting/drafting via command
- Customization Options: names (easy), different bracket backgrounds (kinda hard), bracket themes (really fucking hard), custom coin images (easy) (capture the vibe of the custom-made bracket images, but abstract away the manual labor)
- Multiple Brackets at the same time?
- Automatic Tournaments w/ a simulator/AI? (idk if this is a good idea)
- Stats Displays!
